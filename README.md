> novella lets you manage stories

Novella is a command-line tool that allows users to create and manage stories based on text files.

## Usage

At this moment, novella is very barebones, consisting of just core modules and a dream. Below are planned usages for it.

```
novella [command]
    init <title> <path> Creates a new story
    compile             Compiles story
novella chapter [command]
    add                 Creates a new chapter
```
